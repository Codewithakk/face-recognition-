#Predict which celebrity you look likePredict which celebrity you look like
I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a Python AI Face Recognition application! ðŸš€

Using Python, Keras, Teachable Machine, NumPy, and Tkinter, I've developed a user-friendly tool that allows you to upload your dataset of faces and predict which celebrity you resemble the most! ðŸ¤©

Key features include:

Upload your own dataset of face using Laptop/PC Cam.
Utilize Keras for deep learning models.
Implement Teachable Machine for Training.
Process data efficiently with NumPy.
Provide a sleek user interface using Tkinter.
Whether you're curious about your celebrity doppelganger or want to explore the capabilities of AI in facial recognition, this project offers a fun and insightful experience! It Predicts Which Celebrity You look likeðŸ’¡

I've learned a great deal throughout this project, from data preprocessing to model training, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. ðŸŒŸ
